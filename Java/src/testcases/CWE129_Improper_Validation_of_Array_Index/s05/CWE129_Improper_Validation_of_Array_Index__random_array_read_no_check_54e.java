 * @description
 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: random Set data to a random value
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_read_no_check
 *    GoodSink: Read from array after verifying index
 *    BadSink : Read from array without any verification of index
 * Flow Variant: 54 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one method through three others to a fifth; all five functions are in different classes in the same package
